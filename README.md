# Text-Representation-with-Binary-Trees
Data Structure Project 1 

Project Description given in the project file: 
-In text classification studies, textual materials are represented with the frequencies of
the words.
-Suppose that the number of accesses to word in your tree is directly the frequency of the word given in the input.txt file. Construct a BT to keep these records in the main memory so as to minimize the total access time, where one time unit is the time taken to compare the key of a tree with the key searched.

format of "input.txt" file:
order,word,frequency of word
